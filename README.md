# Diabetes-Prediction-System
Diabetes Prediction System using Classification Models
This project aims to create an advanced diabetes prediction system using machine learning techniques. Diabetes is a common chronic condition affecting millions worldwide, often leading to severe complications if undiagnosed or untreated. Early detection is crucial for effective management, timely interventions, and better patient outcomes, thus alleviating pressure on healthcare systems.
The system is designed as a smart diagnostic tool that analyzes health data provided by users. By applying machine learning algorithms, it identifies patterns and correlations to predict an individual's risk of developing diabetes. The goal is to offer users a detailed risk assessment through an easy-to-use interface.
Additionally, the system provides personalized lifestyle recommendations and preventive measures, empowering users to take proactive control of their health. By integrating technology with healthcare, this system aims to raise awareness, promote early diagnosis, and improve disease management globally.
